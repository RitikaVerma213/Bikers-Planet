        Mumbai (also known as Bombay, the official name until 1995) is the
        capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra. Mumbai lies on the
        Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour.
        In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city. It is also the wealthiest
        city in India, and has the highest number of millionaires and
        billionaires among all cities in India.

        The seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were home to
        communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people. For Bombay in the
        19th century was characterised by economic and educational development.
        During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian
        independence movement. Upon Indiaâ€™s independence in 1947 the city was
        incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta
        Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay
        as the capital.
