        A gift of the Himalayas to the world. Manali is a beautiful township
        nestled in the picturesque Beas River valley. It is a rustic enclave
        known for its cool climate and snow-capped mountains, offering respite
        to tourists escaping scorching heat of the plains. The tourism industry
        in Manali started booming only in the early 20th century, mainly because
        of its natural bounties and salubrious climate.

        Once a sleepy village, the modern town cocooned in its rich cultural
        heritage and age-old traditions is now one of the most popular
        destinations of India. The place is a classic blend of peace and
        tranquillity which makes it a haven for nature lovers and adventure
        enthusiasts, who want to get off the main tourist trails and experience
        nature up close. The glacial water of River Beas after rushing down the
        slopes of Rohtang Pass allows adventure sport activities of rowing white
        water rafting and river crossing as it meanders through the valley from
        Manali to Kullu.
