        By Air: Bangalore is extremely well-connected by regular flights from
        Delhi, Mumbai and most other important cities in India and also has
        international carriers flowing in and out of the Bengaluru International
        Airport, which is located about 40 kilometres from the main city. A taxi
        from the airport would take about 45 minutes to reach the city.

        By Rail: Bangalore has two important railway stations - Bengaluru City
        Railway Station and Yeswantpur Junction. Both railway stations have
        regular trains running from Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and other major cities.
        For travelling within Bangalore, there is Namma Metro (with limited
        connectivity), which is an intra-city rail network set up by the
        Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation.

        By Road: Bangalore is well-connected by a network of buses from cities
        like Goa, Mumbai, Pune, Coimbatore and Mangalore. The options range from
        regular buses to air-conditioned, Volvo and sleeper coaches. While some
        of the buses are run by Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation,
        there are also a number of private bus operators who run inter-city
        buses to and from Bangalore.
