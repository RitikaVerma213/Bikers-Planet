        Now our road takes us to the magnificent kingdom of Goa. The people of
        this kingdom are strong, prudent and very hardworking. The kingdom of
        Goa is the most important in India. It is civilized, having famous
        orchards and water. It is the coolest place in India and it is the most
        plentiful in foodstuffs. The white people make a practice of going to
        the kingdom of Goa to enjoy the shade and the groves of trees and to
        savour the sweet betel. These revealing remarks on Goa come not from the
        hippies or ‘flower power’ generation of the sixties and early seventies
        who thronged the beaches of Anjuna, Vagator and Arambol in search of
        salvation and ‘peace’.

        Whoever has been in Goa may say that he has seen the choicest rarities
        of India, for it is the most famous and celebrated city, on account of
        its commercial intercourse with people of all nationalities of the East
        who bring there the products of their respective countries, articles of
        merchandize, necessaries of life and other commodities in great
        abundance because every year more than a thousand ships touch there
        laden with cargo as for the multitude of people, it is a marvel to see
        the number which come and go every day by sea and land on business of
        every kind. One would say that a fair was being held every day for the
        sale of all sorts of merchandise.
