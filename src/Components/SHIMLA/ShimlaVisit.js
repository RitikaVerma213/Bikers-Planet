        By Air: All three airports in Himachal Pradesh are well-connected to
        major cities like Delhi, Chandigarh, Mumbai and Kolkata. However, it is
        important to bear in mind that these airports are functional only in the
        summer.

        By Rail: Given its mountainous terrain, not all of Himachal Pradesh is
        connected by the railway network. The main railway line is known as the
        Kangra Valley Railway. This connects Pathankot to Jogindernagar. A ride
        on the Kalka-Shimla Toy Train is an enjoyable experience and a scenic
        way to get to Shimla. Some of the popular trains that stop at stations
        in Himachal Pradesh are the Shimla Kalka Passenger, the Shimla Express
        and the Himalayan Queen. The Shivalik Palace Tourist Coach and the
        Shivalik Queen Tourist Coach are special heritage coaches that operate
        on select dates during the tourist season.

        By Road: The best way to reach Himachal Pradesh is probably by road. The
        rural and urban parts of this state are connected to Jammu and Kashmir,
        Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh through a network of 14 National
        Highways and border roads. Buses by the Himachal Road Transport
        Corporation and private operators ply regularly along these roads.
        Alternatively, tourists can hire private taxis to travel in and around
        Himachal Pradesh.
